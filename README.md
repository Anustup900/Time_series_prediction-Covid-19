# Time_series_prediction-Covid-19
This repository is the code for my thesis of MSc degree in Data Science at the University of Southampton (2020). The title of the thesis is _Predict the Pandemic of COVID-19 using Time-series models and Twitter Data_ 

## Abstract
The aim of this repository was to predict the outbreak of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) in the United States using historic daily confirmed cases and twitter data. In terms of time-series problems, the predicting capabilities of the well-known autoregressive (AR) and a modified Recurrent Neural Network (GRU) with merge layer and dense residual links were compared. 

The main obstacle in this predicting task for nerual networks is that the model is hard to train using a small dataset. Therefore, merge layer is added before linear layer to combine tweets volume as additional features to reach data augmentation and capture the temporal changes of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Besides, dense residual links can effectively restrain over-fitting problem and make the training process more rapid. In addition, Data figure analysis was implemented to gain insight that tweets volume is highly correlated to historic confirmed cases specifically for states hit by the pandemic in an early timeframe. 

In summary, the proposed RNNCON-Res model demonstrates dominating capability in country-level prediction 20 days ahead. 

## Framework
The proposed framework RNNCON_Res is drafted below. The structure consists of three parts: A GRU handle the sequential data and decides by what degree the previous memory and the present input in each time step should be kept. The residual links between GRU units can reach the purposes of fast training and over-fitting prevention. A merge layer is put before the linear layer so that the hidden states generated by the last GRU unit can be combined for the predicting task.

## How to Run
The repository consists of two parts: data figure analysis and the proposed model. 
1. Data Figure Analysis

```python
cd data_figure_analysis
```
Run data_analysis.py to get the time-series distribution and Pearson's r graph of COVID-19 daily confirmed case and tweets volume as the below example in output file

```python
python data_analysis.py
```
A jupyter notebook version of data figure analysis can be found here: <https://github.com/FU-CHANG-KAI/Time_series_prediction-Covid-19/blob/master/data_figure_analysis/notebook/Figure%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb>

2. For the model, go to the corresponding path mentioned above and run it by below example  
```python
cd time_series_models
python main.py --normalize 1 --epochs 2000 --data ./data/daily_cases.txt --tweets ./data/tweets_cases.txt --model RNNCON_Res \
--dropout 0.5 --ratio 0.01 --residual_window 4 --save_dir save --save_name rnncon_res.w-16.h-20.ratio.0.01.hw-4.pt \
--horizon 20 --window 16 --metric 0
```
