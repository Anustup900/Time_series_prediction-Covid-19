# Time_series_prediction-Covid-19
The aim of this repository was to predict the outbreak of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) in the United States using historical daily confirmed cases and twitter data. In terms of time-series problems, the predicting capabilities of the well-known autoregressive (AR) and a modified Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with merge layer and dense residual links were compared. For the proposed RNNCON-Res model, the merge layer combines tweets volume as additional features to capture the temporal changes of the COVID-19 pandemic. Dense residual links can effectively restrain over-fitting problem and make the training process more rapid. In addition, Data figure analysis was implemented to gain insight that tweets volume is highly correlated to historical confirmed cases specifically for states hit by the pandemic in an early timeframe. In summary, the proposed RNNCON-Res model demonstrates dominating capability in country-level prediction.
